### Requirements

This application has been tested on R >= 3.5.0, OSX 10.14 / Windows 7/8/10. R can be downloaded from the main [R Project page](https://www.r-project.org/) or downloaded with the [RStudio Application](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). All modules are maintained for MaxQuant >= 1.6.0.16.



### Description

This repository contains a collection of scripts and pipelines for processing, integrating, and analyzing single-cell proteomics data acquired by mass-spectrometry. It originated from the [SCoPE2 pipeline](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4339954), which was abstracted and generalized so that it can be used [plexDIA](https://scp.slavovlab.net/plexDIA), [pSCoPE](https://scp.slavovlab.net/pSCoPE), and other types of mass-spec proteomics data.
